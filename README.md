A simple Node.js boilerplate with Express, Sequelize, and basic user API setup.

## Features

- ES Modules (`"type": "module"`) support with `import`/`export`
- Express.js server setup with routing
- Sequelize ORM for database integration (MySQL/PostgreSQL support)
- Environment-based configuration management
- Structured logging with Winston
- User routes and controller examples
- Integration with Jest for testing

- Logging is handled by Winston with configurable options.

- Modify config files as needed for your environment and database.

- Tests are configured to run asynchronously with Jest.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- MySQL or compatible database
- npm or yarn

## Setup

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/harishinjamuri/nodejs-boilerplate-rest.git
cd nodejs-boilerplate-rest
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Configure your environment variables

Create a .json file or modify the config files to set your database credentials and other settings inside `src/config/`.

4. Run migrations or create your database tables

5. Start the server

```
npm start
```

Server will be running at http://localhost:3000

## Running Tests
Run tests with:
```
npm test
```

Ensure you start the tests with:

```
node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/.bin/jest
```
to support ESM imports in Jest.
